Even the name of the device was already set. The package arrived in a food parcel cover. The seals of the product was not present. I had to return the product as i feared that it was used.

6,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).",Best buy for any price under ‚Çπ4000,5.0 out of 5 stars,"ANC in this price range definitely is a game changer. Its not the best but, its better than nothing. It doesn't cancel out the higher frequencies but does a good work with giving us a glimpse at the experience that only premium products deliver.Audio profile is not flat. It tends to be a bit more tuned for bass, but its fine for me. And the bass in this is really imoressive.Build quality is pretty good. Its been about a month since i bought it, but still no wears or scratches.And the REALME LINK appisa cherry on top.Overall, i would say its a best buy for any price under ‚Çπ4000.You'll be getting ANC, good sound quality, boosted bass, good built etc."

¬†So this is my second TWS purchase, and I think this is totally worth every rupee you pay. The noise canceling really helps, although you can't expect it to be on Galaxy Buds or Airpods pro level, it very well does its job. The bass is quite good, and through the app you can choose whether you want more bass, balanced  etc. The case also has a nice and compact feel and the lid closes nice and satisfyingly and feels premium, somewhat like airpods.I would 10/10 recommend these."

21,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).",Awesome product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancellation is not as expectedThe noise is just slightly reduced not completely diminished.Second is that the mic quality is also not so good as the sound is sometimes blur.Third is the sound quality which is awesome for a tws as you can feel the depth of sound as well.Fourth thing is the bass which will just satisfy your needs as thale bass is thumping enough vibrate your ears at a normal volume.Fifth is the latency mode which works wellThe touch controls are also goodBattery backup is niceSo, it would be a nice choice if you have budget of 3500 otherwise Realme Buds Air 3 can be a good suggestion compared to Buds 2.The review is after 5 months of use so you may prefer it."

237,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).","Nice, with anc and transpanance mode.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product, pls update the firmware first.PositiveGood sound, (i use it with the tv at night when i dont want to disturb family or neighbours, with the ANC on, bass mode on, high volume, and a good movie i feel like i am in a theater)Comfortable,Light weight,Doesnt fall off easily,Transperancy mode (i dont feel it is in my ears after some time. Makes more comfertable for me, as i mostly use it for calls. And remains on my ears for a long time).ANC is decent.Battery backup is decent. (If low, keep it in the case for 15 mins and it gets quick charge for use again)Negative.The case design is in such a way that you have to rotate and keep the buds in the case. Placing the earbuds back in the case should have been made little more easy.The mic works even outdoors, but my voice sounds like a robotüôÇ, but i am ok with that as long as the other person hear and understand me without trouble.After using for more than a month, the right earbud some times have issues when i put it back in the case, it doesent charge, so i have to place it again and confirn that the green light glows.Overall a very good product below 3500.Purchase it, i will recommend.But pls update the firmware when prompted.Hope this information helps you in your buying decession."
238,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).",Battery Issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this product 2.5 months back and had to send to service center already twice. At first the right ear stopped working within a week, when it got repaired and came back, the right ear strated giving battery issue. I had to send this again to service center. But afeter getting it back, I am still seeing the right side charge is dropping much quicker than left side. Within 30 mins it's dropping from 100% to 60%. Realme service is good, no doubt. But I can not tell about the repair or product quality. Now I feel I have wasted my 3k and would never prefer to buy Realme products. Hope the Realme group sees this review and try to make some changes in their product quality improvement plans."
239,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).",Poor quality material and worst service.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left air buds stopped working within a month, so gave it for repair and it's been 2 months now and no signs of returning, everytime I contact them they give some excuse and ask me to wait. It's a fraud."

241,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).",Best budget truly wireless earphones with ANC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With the truly wireless earphones industry just exploding after the coming of Airpods, there are many companies which have come with budget offerings. The realme Buds Air 2 is one the best when it comes to the value for money with respect to the features that these earphones are offering. I have created an indepth review and comparison along with an unboxing of these earphones on my youtube channel - Unbox Daily Tech which covers all the aspects of these earphones along with pairing, mic test and realme link app review.The ANC offered by these earphones is decent which is rated at 25 db, although more expensive offering from the likes of Sennheiser and JBL offer ANC of more than 100 db but then they are prices upto 3 times or 4 times than these earphones. The sound quality is decent with a good mix of highs and lows and the overall music listening experience is a pleasure. The earphones are very very lightweight and majority of the times you will completely forget even you are even wearing the same. The design looks premium with a mix of Airpods Pro and Airpods 2. The look and feel of the product is also good which boosts some features like the intelligent touch controls, google smart pair, auto on/off and transparency mode.Overall an amazing deal. Go for these without any doubts."
242,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).","Bass, comfort  quality",3.0 out of 5 stars,First I was using OnePlus buds z  Then I have purchased. This one the function and noise. Cancellation work really well but the problem is that is is not so comfortable. So comfort. Rating is 0  else it's a a good product. When  useing  this just for 1.5-2 hr ear starts paining but when I was using OnePlus buds z for 4-5 hr this never happened. So at last  I will recommend company. To do something with the comfort
243,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).",Extremely good build quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm specially taking my time to write a review because I forgot my realme buds in my jeans pocket, and washed it inside a washing machine for one hour. And surprisingly, both the earbuds are still working fine after spending one hour in detergent water in a washing machine. Compared to my other company's earbuds (boat, I'm lookin at you) , which stopped working after I mistakenly splashed them with 5-6 water drops. Definitely the best earbuds in this range."
244,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).",Absolute Bang for Bugs!!!! Best TWS Product under 3k,5.0 out of 5 stars,1. Sound quality is upto the mark. Very decent in this price bracket2. Connectivity is very good. I‚Äôve been using for a week haven‚Äôt faced any connection drops. Had used on both android and iPhone. The realme link app is available on both android and ios platforms. To my experience buds sound great on iPhone than android !!!3. Features such as Noise cancellation and others works well.4. Battery back is good too. 4.5 hours+ buds on single charges with moderate volume and ANC off.5. Buds surprisingly works well with windows 10 laptop. Features such as pause and play on inear detection also works.Finally opt to buy these at Croma or Reliance Digital stores around Hyderabad  as these are selling for the same price below 3k to avoid purchase and return problems!
245,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).",Max 10-12 hours playback with case,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The charging time is superfast even with the laptop, so that's excellent, however the battery life isn't as good. They claim 25 hours, but I get a max of 12 hours with a fully charged case. I've updated the firmware, got my buds replaced once within 6 months of purchase so the hardware isnt as good as they claimFeatures are great and I love conducting sessions with these as they are ergonomically designed, but the battery life is questionable. I have to put it inside the charging box every 2 hours at a 80% volume, which I need for my sessions. So apart from the battery and hardware, the other features are simply awesome"

Was not expecting such a bad product feom realme."
247,"realme Buds Air 2 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Bluetooth Headset (Closer Black, True Wireless).",Most amazing product from realme,4.0 out of 5 stars,"See, I am using the realme Buds Air Pro for a very long time. I purchased one of them from the realme store on their first sale, and from still then I'm using it.  No issues with sound cancellation. Exceptional. I know many users are here comparing this with apple Airpods. See, if you are doing this, it means that you're not even aware of the price difference. So obviously if you're a apple Airpods user, you'll feel disappointed. So I recommend not to use this product if you're an apple products user for giving negative reviews just. Although the price is a little bit higher, but if you can able to grab during sale, then it would be worth. For Bass , I must say, after turning on the bass boost +  bass increased but if you turn up the volume all the high up, then you'll feel that vocals somewhat fadded. That was my initial impression. But after that I got multiple updates on the product and I must now in 2022, it's been better which I was experienced during my initial days. Kepp up the good work realme and continue to make disruption in the market."

Poor product life.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After used for complete 1 year, case stopped charging. I went to service centre, he ""looked"" at the case and said ye gnda kyu hai sir. I said khreedne k do din bad gnda hogya tha, apko new dekhne ki aadat hai isliye lgrha hai apko. He said replacement not possible as it is out of warranty. He didn't try to repair it. I felt that Real me's service centres are poor at handling clients. I spent 5000 rs for 1 yr. Gotbit repaired for 150rs at local shop though. huh."
